## Description Features

A GaussianBlur_RenderBlur effect for UI Components.

* Render a blurred texture(s) once and reuse it/them
* Adjust Blur and Lightness using C# or JS
* Add alpha mask for different shapes!
* Adjust Quality for mobile/low-end hardware
* Unity Free friendly.
* Fully commented C# code.
* Awesome demos!


>**WARNING!**  
I plan to rewrite this assset (or replace it with GaussianBlur_Mobile).  
Therefore, you will get an obsolete message when using this blur.

## How To Use GaussianBlur_RenderBlur

### Preface

**GaussianBlur_RenderBlur** (folder)  
Contains a Gaussian Blur shader(s), and script(s), that updates global textures when called on.
Call this "Render on Demand". This can be used for low-end devices when you don't need to update the blur every frame, or if you just want to be battery friendly.


#### BlurRenderer.cs

Below is a ScreenShot of the BlurRenderer.cs Script.

**MaxBlur**: the maxium blur used to make the global textures.  
**Quality**: the quality of the blur (the lower the better for mobile)  
**TextureCnt**: the number of global textures generated (5 max)  
**DownRes**: lowering the resolution of the image that is captured from the camera. (the highter the better for mobile).  
**RenderNow**: a trigger mostly used for debugging in the unity editor.

#### GaussianBlur_RenderBlur.shader

Uses properties and the global textures to generate a blurred effect on the screen.

**_Lightnesss**: multiplies the color of the image to make it lighter, or darker.  
**_BlurSize**: A number between 0 and 1, in order to blender between each of the global textures (_Blur#).  
**_AlphaAsBlurSize**: Alpha in your image will be used to calculate the BlurSize.

Below is a diagram to convery how BlurSize is calculated.

* If BlurRenderer generated 5 textures.
	* If your BlurSize is 1, then _Blur4 will be used.
	* If your BlurSize is 0.5 then the shader will use a mix of _Blur1 and _Blur2.
	* If your BlurSize is 0.1 then the shader will used _Blur0 with an alpha of 0.5.

### Troubleshooting

#### It's Blocky?  
If the Shader seems blocky (like in the image below), increase the Quality value in the shader.

#### I've got a ton of Errors!

The Shaders written in Unity get recompiled into 8 different shaders for each rendering engine. Unfortunately  this shader doesn't work with DirectX9 (D3D9), therefore please disable it in the inspector.

If compiling for windows you can choose the graphical API in PlayerSettings

#### Doesn't Do WorldSpace

Sorry, but this method doesn't support WorldSpace canvasses.
*Please let me know if you want this and I will do my best.*

#### Jumpy Update

The blur effect will seem to jump a bit when the texture(s) are updated. (i.e. not a smooth update)
This is something i will be working on in the next few months.
*Let me know if this is a priotity*

>**WARNING!**  
In order to accomplish a fix for this this i might need to render more textures
