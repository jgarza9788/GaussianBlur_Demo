## How To Use GaussianBlur_SRP

### Intro

**GaussianBlur_SRP.shader** will color UI components based on a blured image of whatever is behind it.

There are Two things that allow this Shader to work.
1. A texture of what is rendered by the camera, this can be obtained using the SRP (LWRP/HDRP) Asset.
2. The Shader that will Blur the texture and set the color of the UI Component.


#### SRP (LWRP/HDRP) Asset (aka Pipeline Asset)

- [x] Opaque Texture  
this needs to be checked so we can access the camera's texture.

- [ ] Opaque Downsampling (Optional)  
If you're planning to publish to mobile, consider downsampling.  
i.e. switch this to: 2x Bilinear, 4x Box, or 4x Bilinear
