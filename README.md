## Description Features

* Alpha Mask
* Mobile Friendly
* Adjust Blur, Lightness, Saturation, and TintColor 
* Built on URP
* easily modifiable/editable Shader Graph
* 3 Shaders
    * GaussianBlur_IU
    * GaussianBlur_IUEffect
    * GaussianBlur_WS (WorldSpace, or Objects)

## Set Up
Use the URP_Asset  
it's in ***\GaussianBlur_URP\Assets\URP**

note: this will do several things.
1. Allow us to use _CameraOpaqueTexture (our default texture for blurring)
    1. a custom texture can be used (i.e. a render texture or any 2D texture)
2. Enable Custom rendering for WorldSpaced objects we want blurred.

## GaussianBlur_IU
To use the shader on the UI, just use the material.  
(or create you're own material and use my shader)

CustomTexture:  
pass in any texture you'd like (i.e. a Render Texture or 2D Texture)

useCameraOpaqueTexture:  
this will be used as a default texture for blurring.  
note: this will not render transparent objects (you might want to use a Render Texture)

BlurScale:  
This is how much to blur the texture.  
(This will automatically adjust two other variables)

Lightness:  
how light or dark the UI should be.

Tint:  
a color tint to be applied to the UI.

Saturation:  
adjusts the saturation (color) of the UI.

## GaussianBlur_IUEffect
This will use the Source Image.
So you can fade the blur depending on where it is on the screen.

note:  
edges will be blurred, but less in the center

## GaussianBlur_WS
This is for Objects in the WorldSpace.

note: The Layer should be set to BlurObject.

Metallic & Smoothness:  
these are used to adjust the shinny-ness of the object.  

if this is not working we might want to double check our custom-renderer.
it's in ***\GaussianBlur_URP\Assets\URP**

## FAQs

### it's just GREY!
Please delete the **Settings** folder from the default URP project.  
For some reason this causes an error in the URP_Asset i have included in the project

### incorrect importing 

I have receieved emails about the materials folder not being imported within the assets folder.

### better performance from mobile 

1. use Vulkan 
    * this should be in the PlayerSettings, Other Settings, Rendering.

2. Increase the **Update Rate** in the BlurRenderer.cs script
    * this will update the blur less frequently, however if you are on a pause menu (or something similar) this will cut down on how often your blur is updating. 

3. Lower the quality toggle within the material settings.
    * this will change how it renders, however it should be lighter.
