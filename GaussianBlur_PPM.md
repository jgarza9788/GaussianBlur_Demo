## How To Use GaussianBlur_PPM

### Intro

a gameObject will be set up with a special #C script that will create a texture that our camera will use to know which pixels it will need to blur.

This is how the demo looks

#### BlurEffect.cs
Attach this script to objects that you want to be blurred. 

This Script will create a texture where the pixels that should be blurred are more white then the pixels that should not be blurred.

#### Postprocessing Layer and Postprocessing Volume

Now we need to attach the Post Processing Layer and the Post Processing Volumne to our camera.

Then add the GaussianBlur_PPM to your Post Processing Profile.

> Note: if you don't have Post Processing installed you can get it from the menu (i.e. Window -> Package Manager -> Post Processing)

## Troubleshooting

This method currently doesn't work in in a Canvas.
